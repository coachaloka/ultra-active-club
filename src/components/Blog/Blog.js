                <h3>How does React work?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
                    While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers
                    realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model (DOM) is an
                    application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It
                    defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is
                    accessed and manipulated.). So, to make it faster, React implements a
                    virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript.
                    So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual
                    representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most
                    efficient way to update the browser’s DOM. Unlike browser DOM
                    elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create.
                    React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
                    The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it’s worth
                    keeping a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation. Although React
                    was conceived to be used in the browser, because of its design it can
                    also be used in the server with Node.js.{" "}

        <h3>What is the difference Between State and Props?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
          React is an opensource JavaScript library that offers a visual
          overview of the JavaScript architecture for conventional MVC. React
          promises programmers a model in which substrates cannot directly
          influence enclosing components—data are downstream, data changes in
          HTML are efficiently modified, and the DOM is abstracted to boost
          performance using Virtual DOM. How can we access data from the
          previous component if the data is just being flowed from components to
          components? The answer is props. React uses data transmission props
          that we need to transfer to various components. The difference comes
          in which component the data are owned. State is owned locally and the
          component itself updates it. Props are owned and read-only by a
          parent. Props can be changed only if an upstream shift is caused by a
          callback function passed on to the child. A prop can be passed on to
          the child in the state of a parent. They apply to the same value but
          can only be updated by the parent variable.
